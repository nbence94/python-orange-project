The framework is built based on a simple structure:

- The **utilities** folder stores all helper scripts.
- The **pageObjects** folder contains objects for different pages of the website, utilizing the utilities.
- The **testCases** folder stores the test cases, which are executed by run.bat.
- The **Configuration** folder holds the configuration files.
This structure ensures clarity and organization while practicing Selenium automation.
